## About Me:
Sophomore at FAST University.
Obsessed with exploring the ever-changing world of tech and web development. 
My journey so far has been a wild ride, filled with ups and downs, but always driven by a passion for learning and a desire to push myself to be better.
I love taking on new challenges and trying to master multiple skills at once - it's like a puzzle I can't resist solving. 
Whether it's building innovative solutions, experimenting with new technologies, or creating art that comes to life, I'm always looking for ways to level up and make a meaningful impact.
With a mind that's always racing and a heart that's always eager, I'm fueled by a steady stream of **caffeine** and a determination to become the best version of myself. Every day is a new chance to learn, grow, and create something amazing - so just:
*Trynna do better.*
